    <h1>Data Breach Response Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Update Status: </strong>June 2021</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This Policy mandates that any individual who suspects a theft, breach or exposure of Property.CoZa Protected
        Data or Property.CoZa Sensitive Data has occurred must immediately provide a written description of what has
        occurred via email to support@propertycoza.co.za or through the use of the ticketing platform provided within
        Knowledge Base.
    </p>
    <p>
        Property.CoZa’s Cyber Information Security Team will investigate all reported thefts, data breaches and exposure
        to confirm if a theft, breach or exposure has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a theft, breach or exposure has occurred, the Information Security Administrator will follow the appropriate
        procedure in place.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Property.CoZa holds and processes personal data on behalf of its staff and clients, a valuable asset that needs
        to be suitably protected. Every care is taken to protect personal data from incidents
        (either accidental or deliberate) to avoid a security breach that could compromise data. Compromise
        of information, confidentiality, integrity, or availability may result in harm to individuals, reputational
        damage, detrimental effect on service provision, legislative noncompliance, and/or financial costs including
        significant fines from the Information Regulator.
    </p>

    <p>
        The purpose of the policy is to establish the goals and the vision for the breach response process.
        This policy will clearly define to whom it applies and under what circumstances, and it will include the
        definition of a breach, staff roles and responsibilities, standards and metrics
        (e.g., to enable prioritization of the incidents), as well as reporting, remediation, and feedback mechanisms.
        The policy shall be well publicized and made easily available to all personnel whose duties involve data
        privacy and security protection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Property.CoZa’s intentions for publishing a Data Breach Response Policy are to focus significant attention
        on data security and data security breaches and how Property.CoZa’s established culture of openness,
        trust and integrity should respond to such activity. Property.CoZa is committed to protecting Property.CoZa's
        employees, contractors, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either
        knowingly or unknowingly.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Scope</h2>
    <p>
        This policy covers all computer systems, network devices, and any additional systems and outputs containing
        or transmitting Property.CoZa Protected data or Property.CoZa Sensitive data. This policy also applies to all
        whom collect, access, maintain, distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise
        handle personally identifiable information or Protected Health Information (PHI) of Property.CoZa members.
        Any agreements with vendors will contain language similar that protects the fund.
