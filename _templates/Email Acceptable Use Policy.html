        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <strong>4.j.v</strong> Users must not send confidential company data via email. The IT department can advise on appropriate
            tools use instead.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <strong>4.j.vi</strong> If access of another person’s company email account is required, for instance, while an employee is
            off sick, they should approach their immediate supervisor or Office Administrator to make an official request.
