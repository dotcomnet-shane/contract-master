        In order to make it harder for people to guess your passwords please keep in mind the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Don’t use dictionary words - All real words are easy to guess. Avoid using any words, words in foreign
            languages, swear words, slang, names, nicknames, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            The names of family, friends and partners, anniversary dates, car registrations and telephone numbers are
            the first thing potential crackers will try when guessing your passwords.
        </li>
        <li>
            Instead try to pick acronyms, mnemonics, random letters, etc, or insert non-alphabetic characters in the
            middle of the word, replace letters with numbers (‘o’ to zero, I to 1, E to 3), etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a mIxTuRe of UPPER and lower case on case sensitive systems - Unix and Linux.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must include a number (0-9) somewhere in the password. Try to fit this in somewhere inside whatever
            letters you choose, instead of at the end or beginning of the password.
        </li>
        <li>
            If possible include a symbol (£$%&^*+=) somewhere in the password.
        </li>
        <li>
            When changing passwords, change more than just the number: perhaps move its position within the password,
            add or subtract letters, change capitalisation, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, choose something you can remember. This is very important; it is no good having a password like
            “h498cj3t34” if you have it written on a Post-It Note stuck to your monitor! If you must have a reminder or
            hint, use something cryptic that only you can understand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Never tell anyone else your password or allow them to log in as you. Avoid telling anyone your password on
            the telephone, hackers often call pretending to be from the Information Technology Department and ask for
            your password. If it is necessary to provide your password to someone else to allow a fault to be fixed,
            ensure that they are genuine members of the Information Technology Department first.
        </li>
        <li>
            Try to avoid letting other people watch you key your password in. Choose something that is not easy to guess
            from watching, like “qwerty12345”.
        </li>
    </ul>
